# Release Repository for Personal Website

**Instructions:** Leverage this repository to conveniently publish changes (ie. assemble minimified artifacts) at the development repository to the live github-pages site by running _deploy.sh_ (typically also specifying a commit message via the option _-m "COMMIT_MSG"_, lest you prefer to default to the most recent commit at the development repo).
